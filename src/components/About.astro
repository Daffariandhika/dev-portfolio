                    My name is Riandhika, and I’m a Junior Fullstack Developer
                    with a strong passion for creating impactful applications
                    that solve real-world problems and improve everyday
                    experiences.
                </p>
                <p class="Fade_Up text-justify">
                    I enjoy working across the stack, from designing clean, data
                    driven backends to building intuitive and responsive
                    frontends. My focus is on writing scalable, maintainable
                    code and delivering products that balance performance with
                    usability.
                </p>
                <p class="Fade_Up text-justify">
                    Driven by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning,
                    I embrace new technologies and modern tools to refine my
                    craft. If you’re looking for a motivated developer who’s
                    eager to collaborate and contribute, I’d be excited to help
                    bring your ideas to life.
